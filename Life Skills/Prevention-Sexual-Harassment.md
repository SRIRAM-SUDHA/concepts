# Prevention of Sexual Harassment – Questions & Answers

## Q1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?
**A1.** Sexual harassment includes any **unwelcome behaviour** of a sexual nature that makes someone uncomfortable or creates a hostile place at work. Examples include:

- **Verbal**: Sexual jokes, comments about appearance or body, insults based on sex or gender.   
- **Physical**: Unwanted touching, hugging, groping, cornering, or blocking movement. 
- **Visual or non-verbal**: Displaying pornographic images, leering, sexual gestures, or sexually suggestive body language. 
- **Quid pro quo**: Offering job benefits in exchange for sexual favors, or threatening harm for refusal.
- It also creates a **hostile work environment** when repeated or severe—whether physical, verbal, or visual. 

## Q2. What would you do if you face or witness such behaviour?
**A2.** Here's what you can do:

1. **Firmly say "No"** or ask them to stop, if you feel safe doing so. 
2. **Document what happened** – note the date, time, place, what was said or done, and any witnesses. Keep any relevant messages or images. 
3. **Report the incident** asap:
   - To your **Internal Complaints Committee (ICC)** or HR, following your organization's POSH policy. 
   - If you are a witness, you can report on behalf of the person affected.   
4. Seek **confidentiality and a fair process**. Organize’s policy should protect your identity during the investigation. 
5. If organizational steps fail or harassment continues, you may consider **legal action** under applicable laws (like the POSH Act, 2013 in India). 
6. Always **support the person affected**, whether yourself or a colleague, and **don’t hesitate to ask for help or guidance**.
